                            my strength has more than doubled. They really
                            helped me by giving me the tools to grow. regimes.

                            met and trained with a couple of the other trainers
                            in this company. I aim to continue to train and
                            maintain a good level of fitness with their help for
                            a long time to come.

                            Yo Fit Personal Training is really great. I was
                            skinny but too unmotivated and shy to go to the gym.
                            I had Russell Laurie as my personal trainer and now
                            I noticed a positive change in my appearance. I am
                            happy and now more confident with myself.

                            committed trainers around. I started training once a
                            week, as part of a group session, really enjoyed the
                            variety & challenge

                            sessions challenging but rewarding. I would have no
